  <p style="margin-top:40px"><h2>WEBTOON</h2>
    While webtoons were mostly unknown outside of Korea during their inception, there has been a surge in popularity internationally thanks in great part to the rise in popularity of manhwa and the fact that most manhwa are released as webtoons.[1] In the country, as digital manhwa have emerged as a popular medium, print publication of manhwa has decreased.[citation needed] The amount of material published in webtoon form has now reached an equal amount as that published offline.[2]<br><br>
